## 🎨 Philosophy & Design

**[Flatcap](https://github.com/cheycron/flatcap-theme)** draws inspiration from the *Nord theme*, embracing principles of calm, clean aesthetics, and a dimmed pastel color approach.

### Color Palette

The system relies on **20 core colors** divided into four distinct families.

| Family | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Deep Twilight** | Structural foundation. Deep backgrounds (`#121418`) and sidebars (`#191c22`). |
| **Dawnlight** | Typography hierarchy. From muted metadata (`#b2b6bf`) to crisp body text (`#cbced5`). |
| **Ocean Blues** | Primary interaction. Calming blues (`#81a1c1`) for actions and navigation. |
| **Vivid Accents** | Semantic feedback. Desaturated accents for errors (`#bf616a`) and success (`#a3be8c`). |
